# landing-page

This project is part of The Odin Project. It's my first experience in CSS and is supposed to better my ability, to style webpages. It's entirely built on CSS and HTML. The font used is 'Roboto' (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and the image used was created and published on Unsplash.com (https://unsplash.com/photos/dxtkv8qLaY0) by @deepmind.
